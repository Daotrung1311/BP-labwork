BASIC PROGRAMMING DEMO EXAM
Exercise 1(5 points):
Write a program to output the following text exactly as it appears here by using printf one time only:
"This's our C programming course".
"Welcome to the first tutorial class".
Exercise 2 (5 points): 
Write a C program to calculate a value of a polynomial 洧녩洧논2 + 洧녪洧논 + 洧녫 with three known constant parameters a=1, b=2, and c=1 and the variable 洧논 input from the keyboard.
Exercise 3 (5 points):
 Write a C program to find a factorial of n, n is an integer input from the keyboard.
Exercise 4 (5 points): 
Write a function in C to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive integer numbers.
All the functions should be defined in two separated files: *.h and *.c
